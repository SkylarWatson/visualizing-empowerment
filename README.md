# Visualizing Empowerment

## Description

`empowerment-visualization.xlsx` is a spreadsheet to graph the data provided from the [Circles and Soup](https://www.tastycupcakes.org/2011/08/circles-and-soup/) exercise, where the theme is empowerment.

Circles and Soup is an activity that was introduced by [Diana Larsen]( https://twitter.com/DianaOfPortland ) as a retrospective technique.

This spreadsheet was a collaboration of work done by Mathew Carlson, Mike Vitale, and Skylar Watson.
